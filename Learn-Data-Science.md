# Learn Data Science

R and Python are two popular languages for data science. We use both at [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com).

**This is a short guide for R.**

It’s quick and everything is completely free. Follow in order for a smoother ride.

### Setup

Download [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio (Desktop version)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).

### Getting Started

Get a [quick overview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-course) of data science.

Complete [Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com). Then read about [data structures](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html) and [subsetting](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html). The `str()` command will be a favorite as you learn.

### Your First Model
