# Data Science for Software Engineers

R and Python are two popular languages for data science.

**This is a short guide to learning R.**

Itâ€™s quick and everything is completely free. Follow the order for a smoother ride.

### Setup

Download [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio (Desktop version)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).

### Getting Started

Complete [Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com). Then read about [data structures](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html) and [subsetting](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html). The `str()` command will be a favorite as you learn.

### Your First Model

Kaggle is a platform for data science challenges. Complete the [first challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) by following this [great tutorial](http://trevorstephens.com/post/72916401642/titanic-getting-started-with-r).
